# Demo Recipe App with Spring, MongoDB and Gradle
This project was forked from a Springframeworkguru and worked through to demonstrate the use of MongoDB and Gradle (as 
opposed to MySQL and Maven) with Spring 5. This project will also form part of the Reactive programming part of the course.

Like other projects on the course, we use CircleCI to automate and signify the completion of building and testing 
of the project. Deployment to a cloud service is not part of the project at this stage.
